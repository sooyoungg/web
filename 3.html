    JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
    language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9] JavaScript is high-level,
    often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax,
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the
    World Wide Web.[10] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
    often incorporating third-party libraries.[12] All major web browsers have
    a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
